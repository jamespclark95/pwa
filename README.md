# Progressive Budget Tracker

This application will track your expenses and income Online & Offline. The magic lays within the Service Worker JS file.
First, we decide which files we'd like to cache on the machine. When we cache these files, we're able to use this application offline.
Any changes that we make without internet, will then be logged and documented once we connect to internet.
